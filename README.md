### Summary of Project and Outcome

During my senior year of highschool(2019-2020), I built a pan-tilt servo-controlled gimbal to hold a low-cost "Light Imaging Detection and Ranging"(LIDAR) module so that I could program an arduino microcontroller
to create a point cloud rendition of the surrounding environment. I had been competed in Science Fair competitions since I was in 6th grade; however, this project was the one I took the most pride in.


I competed on the highschool, regional and state-level in Louisiana and subsequently won 3rd place out of 12 projects in Robotics and Embedded Systems division.
